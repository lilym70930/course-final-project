# course-final-project
Let’s Meet Website for networking and meetups. In this website, you can create or share a meetup, and be an active member by using the group chat, or connecting with other members one-on-one in a private chat (click on the person’s name and send a message!). Additionally, you can keep up to date on news in the technology sector.
This project is an end-to-end website and includes the following technologies:
Client: React and socket.io-client were used for building the chat on the client side. I also used NewsAPI for the news section in the web.
Server: Node.js + express and socket.io were also used for the server side. 
DataBase: mongoDB (registration information)
installation:
Client: (client- - src) npm install then: npm start
Server: (server - - -index.js): npm install, then in order to run the server: 
(1)	If you have nodemon you can use it in index.js file. 
(2)	Or you can use node on index.js file.
After installing:
